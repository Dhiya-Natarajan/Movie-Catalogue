## Architecture and Database Design

The system is built on a client-server architecture with a relational database model. This design ensures efficient data organization and clear separation of concerns.

### Database ERD


[Database ERD](./Pictures/ER_Diagram.png)
 
### Database Schema

The database consists of four primary tables:

*   `users`: Stores user profile and authentication data (username, hashed password, email).
*   `movies`: Acts as a local cache or reference for movies, though most data is fetched live from the TMDB API.
*   `user_watchlist`: A junction table mapping users to the movies they've added to their watchlist (Many-to-Many relationship).
*   `user_likes`: A junction table mapping users to the movies they've marked as favorites (Many-to-Many relationship).

Foreign key constraints and indexes on `user_id` and `movie_id` are used to maintain data integrity and optimize query performance.

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your machine:
*   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (v14 or later)
*   [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
*   A running [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) server

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/Dhiya-Natarajan/Movie-Catalogue.git
    cd Movie-Catalogue
    ```

2.  **Setup the Backend:**
    *   Navigate to the backend directory:
        ```sh
        cd backend
        ```
    *   Install NPM packages:
        ```sh
        npm install
        ```
    *   Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory and add the following environment variables.
        ```env
        # .env
        DB_HOST=localhost
        DB_USER=your_mysql_user
        DB_PASSWORD=your_mysql_password
        DB_NAME=your_database_name
        JWT_SECRET=your_super_secret_jwt_key
        TMDB_API_KEY=your_tmdb_api_key
        ```
    *   Set up the database. Create a database in your MySQL server and run the provided schema file.
        ```sh
        # Replace with your actual credentials and schema file name
        mysql -u your_mysql_user -p your_database_name < schema.sql 
        ```
    *   Start the backend server:
        ```sh
        npm start
        ```
        The server will be running on `http://localhost:8800` (or the port you configure).

3.  **Setup the Frontend:**
    *   Open a new terminal and navigate to the frontend directory:
        ```sh
        cd frontend
        ```
    *   Install NPM packages:
        ```sh
        npm install
        ```
    *   Start the React development server:
        ```sh
        npm start
        ```
        The application will open automatically in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

## API Integration

This project relies heavily on **The Movie Database (TMDB) API** for all movie-related data.

*   To use the application, you need a TMDB API key.
*   You can obtain a free API key by creating an account on the [TMDB Website](https://www.themoviedb.org/signup).
*   Once you have your key, add it to the `.env` file in the `backend` directory as `TMDB_API_KEY`.

---

## Challenges & Solutions

During development, several challenges were encountered and resolved:

*   **Challenge**: Exceeding the TMDB API rate limits during testing.
    *   **Solution**: Implemented caching for common queries on the backend to reduce redundant API calls and stay within the usage quota.

*   **Challenge**: Designing a database schema that avoids redundancy while allowing fast data retrieval for user-specific lists.
    *   **Solution**: Utilized a normalized relational database design with junction tables (`user_watchlist`, `user_likes`) and foreign keys to efficiently manage many-to-many relationships.

*   **Challenge**: Managing secure user sessions and token expiration.
    *   **Solution**: Implemented JWT-based authentication with token refreshing mechanisms and stored tokens securely in HTTP-only cookies to protect session data.

---

## Future Enhancements

The following features are planned for future releases:

*   **User Reviews & Ratings**: Allow users to write reviews and give personal ratings to movies.
*   **Recommendation Engine**: Build a simple recommendation system based on a user's liked movies and viewing history.
*   **Mobile App Compatibility**: Develop a dedicated mobile application using React Native for an even better mobile experience.
*   **Social Features**: Allow users to follow each other and see what their friends are watching.
